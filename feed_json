Of course a ROM can overhaul nearly every aspect of the phone, the problem of course is that it&#39;s much easier to download a launcher from the play store than it is to install a custom ROM.

I use the same fragment throughout the app filtering the data as needed.<\/p> <p>Filtering is done by having parameters passed through the Factory to the DataSource. All this works fine if I only have one fragment loaded. I can filter and search just fine.<\/p> <p>Problems start when trying to load multiple fragments in a ViewPager. For example Fragment A - is filtered to show active items Fragment B - is filtered to show expired items both are to be displayed in a ViewPager using FragmentPagerAdapter. When I run the app both Fragments get filted for expired items (the last fragment added to viewpager) It seems the parameters that Fragment A set in the DataSource are overwritten immediately by Fragment B. Fragment A loadInitial works as it should but loadAfter is using the parameters from Fragment B.<\/p> <p>should also note if I invalidate() the DataSource it returns the correct filtered data without issue. (so its just when loaded my params get overwritten and loadAfter uses incorrect param)<\/p> <p>Tried messing with the Observer using getViewLifecycleOwner() trying to figure if they way I am calling the DataSource is the issue, Tried the various ViewPager Adapters FragmentStatePagerAdapter and FragmentPagerAdapter. <\/p> <p>All the checks show the DataSource getting the correct parameter then show it getting overwritten almost immediately.<\/p> <p>So question is the call to PageKeyedDataSource not unique to the Fragment Calling it? Why are my variables being overwritten by another fragment.<\/p> <p>Can anyone say where I should be looking to resolve this issue.<\/p> <p>Side note I have three fragments loaded using FragmentStatePagerAdapter with 2 of 3 being the Same Fragment Called with different params. It works fine because with three fragments loaded the FragmentStatePagerAdapter apparently doesnt initialize the 3rd fragment until after everything is loaded so it does not trip over the other fragment.<\/p> <p>&#x200B;<\/p> <p>Any sample code or guidance to ensure calls to the datasource are for lack of a better term &quot;unique&quot; because when using the ViewPager it creates the 2 fragments same time which seem to be using the one Datasource.<\/p> <p>&#x200B;<\/p> <p>Regards.<\/p> <\/div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spaznuski\"> /u/spaznuski <\/a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/aqqz9r/paging_library_using_pagekeyeddatasource_multiple/\">[link]<\/a><\/span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/aqqz9r/paging_library_using_pagekeyeddatasource_multiple/\">[comments]<\/a><\/span>",

I noticed that their help documents emphasized &quot;core functionality&quot; hinging on &quot;the most prominent feature in your app listing&quot;(paraphrasing), so since I have no other leads on why they are rejecting my caller ID/spam blocking app, I decided I would rewrite the store listing to emphasize that that is the core feature of the app. So I did. I was planning on submitting a new APK later with another declarations form.<\/p> <p>However, just updating the store listing apparently triggers a new review even though I was not prompted to fill out the permissions form again. So I received another rejection(store listing was NOT updated although my changes are saved in the play console).<\/p> <p>This new email again states that they cannot verify the functionality of my app, but now it includes a second note: <\/p> <blockquote> <p>Your app needs to be using runtime permissions for us to complete the review. Please update your app to target API level 26 or above and resubmit the declaration form.<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Needless to say, my app does use runtime permissions/targets API 26 and has for probably a year now. I thought we were now past the cutoff for even submitting updates targeting earlier APKs. So this is another nonsensical response - although considering all of the issues with this process, it might be a goose chase to even assume they meant to include that bit in the email to begin with.<\/p> <p>OR! Does anyone think it&#39;s actually possible that their testing AI needs the first thing in the app to be the permissions requests? My app has a welcome screen on first launch that explains things before asking for permissions. Is it actually possible that their system can&#39;t get past this screen to catch the permissions prompts? If that&#39;s the case, then the app would have to purposely ask for permissions immediately instead of when they&#39;re needed like we&#39;re supposed to.<\/p> <p>Another new thing - the email states that I can apply for a &quot;provisional approval&quot; for this update by submitting a new declaration form and choosing &quot;does not meet the sms and call log permissions policy&quot;. Sounds like a trap to me.<\/p> <p>Has anyone else seen these changes in their responses yet?<\/p> <p>edit: out of curiosity, I put my permissions requests right at launch, and while i was predictably rejected again, i did not have the API 26 message in the next rejection letter.
